## Introduction
Requestix is a decentralized ticketing platform built on the Ethereum blockchain using the Request Network to facilitate seamless ticket purchases and payments. Users can buy tickets through payment requests generated by the platform, which must be paid within 48 hours. Upon payment confirmation, tickets are registered on a smart contract to validate the purchase. The platform also allows users to create and sell tickets for their own events, ensuring a secure and transparent process through blockchain technology. By leveraging the Request Network's decentralized payment system, Requestix reduces transaction fees and enhances the efficiency and transparency of the ticketing process.

## Problem Statement

* Limited transparency - Traditional systems lack clear transaction traceability and ticket ownership verification, making it difficult to track authentic ticket transfers and validate ownership.

* Poor user experience - Most blockchain platforms present complex technical interfaces and processes, creating significant barriers for non-technical users during ticket purchases.

* Security risks - Centralized control in existing systems makes them vulnerable to fraud, unauthorized reselling, and potential security breaches.

* Restricted flexibility - Event organizers face limitations in customizing ticket sales, managing transactions, and implementing specific event requirements efficiently.
